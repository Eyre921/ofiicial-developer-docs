Learn best practices for optimizing search queries and implementing efficient async patterns with Perplexity's Search API.

***

## Overview

This guide covers essential best practices for getting the most out of Perplexity's Search API, including query optimization techniques and efficient async usage patterns for high-performance applications.

## Query Optimization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write specific queries">
    Use highly specific queries for more targeted results. For example, instead of searching for "AI", use a detailed query like "artificial intelligence machine learning healthcare applications 2024".

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      # Better: Specific query
      search = client.search.create(
          query="artificial intelligence medical diagnosis accuracy radiology",
          max_results=10
      )

      # Avoid: Vague query
      search = client.search.create(
          query="AI medical",
          max_results=10
      )
      ```

      ```typescript Typescript theme={null}
      // Better: Specific query
      const search = await client.search.create({
          query: "artificial intelligence medical diagnosis accuracy radiology",
          max_results: 10
      });

      // Avoid: Vague query
      const search = await client.search.create({
          query: "AI medical",
          max_results: 10
      });
      ```

              "snippet": "- **Study shows AI improves performance for some radiologists but worsens it for others.**\n- **Understanding who might benefit from AI and who would not is critical for designing tools that boost human performance.**\n- **The findings underscore the importance of tailored AI-clinician integration over a one-size-fits-all approach.**\nOne of the most touted promises of medical artificial intelligence tools is their ability to augment human clinicians’ performance by helping them interpret images such as X-rays and CT scans with greater precision to make more accurate diagnoses.\nBut the benefits of using AI tools on image interpretation appear to vary from clinician to clinician, according to new research led by investigators at Harvard Medical School, working with colleagues at MIT and Stanford.\n...\nThe study findings suggest that individual clinician differences shape the interaction between human and machine in critical ways that researchers do not yet fully understand.\n...\nIn some instances, the research showed, use of AI can interfere with a radiologist’s performance and interfere with the accuracy of their interpretation.\n“We find that different radiologists, indeed, react differently to AI assistance — some are helped while others are hurt by it,” said co-senior author Pranav Rajpurkar, assistant professor of biomedical informatics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.\n“What this means is that we should not look at radiologists as a uniform population and consider just the ‘average’ effect of AI on their performance,” he said.\n...\n“Individual factors and variation would be key in ensuring that AI advances rather than interferes with performance and, ultimately, with diagnosis,” Yu said.\n...\nWhile previous research has shown that AI assistants can, indeed, boost radiologists’ diagnostic performance, these studies have looked at radiologists as a whole without accounting for variability from radiologist to radiologist.\n...\nThe researchers examined how AI tools affected the performance of 140 radiologists on 15 X-ray diagnostic tasks — how reliably the radiologists were able to spot telltale features on an image and make an accurate diagnosis.\n...\nThe effect of AI assistance was inconsistent and varied across radiologists, with the performance of some radiologists improving with AI and worsening in others.\n...\nAI’s effects on human radiologists’ performance varied in often surprising ways.\nFor instance, contrary to what the researchers expected, factors such how many years of experience a radiologist had, whether they specialized in thoracic, or chest, radiology, and whether they’d used AI readers before, did not reliably predict how an AI tool would affect a doctor’s performance.\nAnother finding that challenged the prevailing wisdom: Clinicians who had low performance at baseline did not benefit consistently from AI assistance.\nSome benefited more, some less, and some none at all.\nOverall, however, lower-performing radiologists at baseline had lower performance with or without AI.\nThe same was true among radiologists who performed better at baseline.\nThey performed consistently well, overall, with or without AI.\nThen came a not-so-surprising finding: More accurate AI tools boosted radiologists’ performance, while poorly performing AI tools diminished the diagnostic accuracy of human clinicians.\n...\nThe researchers cautioned that their findings do not provide an explanation for why and how AI tools seem to affect performance across human clinicians differently, but note that understanding why would be critical to ensuring that AI radiology tools augment human performance rather than hurt it.\n...\nApart from improving the accuracy of the AI tools, it’s also important to train radiologists to detect inaccurate AI predictions and to question an AI tool’s diagnostic call, the research team said.\nTo achieve that, AI developers should ensure that they design AI models that can “explain” their decisions.",

## Performance Optimization Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Optimize result count">
    Request only the number of results you actually need. More results = longer response times.

    ```python theme={null}
    # Good: Request only what you need
    search = client.search.create(query="AWS re:Invent generative AI announcements", max_results=5)

    # Avoid: Over-requesting results
    search = client.search.create(query="AWS re:Invent generative AI announcements", max_results=50)
