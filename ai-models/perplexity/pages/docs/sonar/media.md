Send and receive images, videos, and files with the Sonar API

## Overview

The Sonar API supports comprehensive media handling: send images and files for analysis, and receive images and videos in responses. This guide covers all media functionality in one place.

## Sending Images

Send images to the API for analysis using either base64 encoding or HTTPS URLs. Images are embedded in the `messages` array alongside text content.

<Warning>
  * Base64 images: Maximum 50 MB per image. Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF
  * HTTPS URLs: Must be publicly accessible and point directly to the image file
</Warning>

### Base64 Encoded Images

Use base64 encoding when you have the image file locally:

```python Python SDK theme={null}
from perplexity import Perplexity
import base64

client = Perplexity()

# Read and encode image as base64
with open("path/to/your/image.png", "rb") as image_file:
    base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
    image_data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}"

# Analyze the image
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe this image?"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_data_uri}}
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### HTTPS URL Images

Reference images hosted online:

```python Python SDK theme={null}
from perplexity import Perplexity

client = Perplexity()

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe the image at this URL?"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_url}}
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Key Parameters

* **Image format**: Use `data:image/{format};base64,{content}` for base64 (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`)
* **Token pricing**: Images are tokenized as `(width × height) / 750` tokens, priced at input token rates
* **Supported formats**: PNG (`image/png`), JPEG (`image/jpeg`), WEBP (`image/webp`), GIF (`image/gif`)

## Sending Files

Upload documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF) for analysis using URLs or base64 encoding. Files can be provided as publicly accessible URLs or base64 encoded bytes without any prefix.

<Warning>
  Maximum file size is 50MB per file. Files larger than this limit will not be processed.
</Warning>

### Using a Public URL

```python Python SDK theme={null}
from perplexity import Perplexity

client = Perplexity()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize this document"},
                {
                    "type": "file_url",
                    "file_url": {"url": "https://example.com/document.pdf"}
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using Base64 Encoding

```python Python SDK theme={null}
from perplexity import Perplexity
import base64

client = Perplexity()

# Read and encode file (no prefix needed)
with open("document.pdf", "rb") as file:
    encoded_file = base64.b64encode(file.read()).decode('utf-8')

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize this document"},
                {
                    "type": "file_url",
                    "file_url": {"url": encoded_file}  # Just base64 string, no prefix
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Key Parameters

* **Supported formats**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF
* **Base64 encoding**: Provide only the base64 string without `data:` prefix
* **File size limit**: 50MB per file, maximum 30 files per request
* **URL requirements**: Must be publicly accessible and return the file directly

## Receiving Images

Control which images are returned in API responses using `return_images`, `image_domain_filter`, and `image_format_filter` parameters.

<Info>
  The `return_images` feature is currently only available in the Sonar API.
</Info>

### Basic Image Returns

Enable image returns by setting `return_images: true`:

```python Python SDK theme={null}
from perplexity import Perplexity

client = Perplexity()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar",
    return_images=True,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Describe the James Webb Space Telescope's deep field observations and what they reveal about the early universe."}
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

nothing important competes with it.[1][2][4]  \n   - Use of compositional tools such as:\n     - **Leading lines, framing, and foreground interest** to guide the eye.[1][2]  \n     - Smart use of **rule of thirds / off‑center placement** for dynamism.[1]  \n     - **Simplicity and minimal distractions**—clutter, stray branches, or bright patches are minimized or excluded.[1][2][4]  \n   - Award winners often have a **multi‑layered composition** (foreground, midground, background) or an intentionally minimalist design that feels deliberate.[1][2]\n\n4. **Exceptional use of light**  \n   - Light is rarely “neutral”: it adds **drama, depth, and mood**.[1][2][4]  \n   - Many award‑winning images exploit **golden hour, low‑angle, backlight, side‑light, or storm light** for texture and atmosphere.[1][2]  \n   - Good light also ensures **rich tonal contrast** without losing important detail in shadows or highlights.[1][2]\n\n5. **Technical excellence (craftsmanship)**  \n   - **Critical sharpness** where it matters (eyes in wildlife, key textures in landscapes) and appropriate depth of field.[1][4][5]  \n   - **Accurate, controlled exposure**: no distracting blown highlights, blocked shadows, or excessive noise; use of histogram, bracketing, and manual control is common.[1][4]  \n   - Clean files (no obvious dust spots, halos, or heavy artifacts) and competent handling of motion (freeze vs. blur) that supports the story.[1][4][5]  \n   - Major competitions explicitly score **technical excellence** alongside composition and impact.[5]\n\n6. **Clarity of subject and simplification**  \n   - The frame is **edited in‑camera**: everything included has a purpose.[1][2][4]  \n   - Backgrounds are often simplified using:\n     - **Careful camera position** to avoid bright or messy areas.[1][2]  \n     - **Shallow depth of field** in wildlife/close‑up to isolate the subject.[1]  \n   - Distractions may be controlled later via cropping, as long as the crop supports balance and “breathing room.”[1][2]\n\n7. **Thoughtful, restrained post‑processing**  \n   - Editing **enhances but does not overwhelm** the natural look of the scene.[1][4]  \n   - Judges tend to reject images with **obvious over‑saturation, heavy filters, or unrealistic colors/contrast** in nature categories.[1]  \n   - Many contests stress staying **true to reality** in nature and wildlife divisions, within reasonable artistic latitude.[1][3][6]\n\n8. **Personal vision and fine‑art quality**  \n   - Top‑tier award work shows a **consistent personal style or vision**, not just one lucky frame.[3]  \n   - Organizations like NANPA emphasize **mastery of both artistic and technical aspects** and the ability to create images that are not only beautiful but also **inspire appreciation for nature**.[3]  \n   - This often means a recognizable approach to mood, color palette, composition, or subject choice across a body of work.[3]\n\n9. **Subject choice and significance**  \n   - The subject is often **visually or biologically compelling**: rare behavior, pristine or fragile habitats, dramatic weather, or subtle, intimate scenes that reveal nature in a new way.[1][4][7]  \n   - Strong images frequently **communicate something unique, informative, or thought‑provoking** about the natural world, not just its surface beauty.[4][6]\n\n10. **Ethical and contextual suitability**  \n   - For major contests, nature/wildlife images must typically be of **wild, non‑captive animals in natural settings** and adhere to ethical guidelines.[6]  \n   - Authenticity of behavior and habitat, and respect for the subject and environment, are increasingly part of what makes an image award‑worthy in respected competitions.[3][6]\n\nIf you’d like, I can translate these characteristics into a practical checklist you can use when shooting or editing, or analyze a sample image (described or uploaded) against these criteria.",

          "content": "The modern Winter Olympic Games began with **Chamonix 1924** and have evolved from a small European-focused festival of six sports into a global mega-event featuring more than 100 medal events, thousands of athletes, and over 90 nations, held on a separate four‑year cycle from the Summer Games since **1994**.[1][3]\n\nBelow is a concise chronological overview, focusing on major milestones in hosting, political context, program changes, and structural reforms.\n\n---\n\n### Origins and early years (1924–1936)\n\n- **Pre‑1924 background**  \n  Winter sports such as **figure skating** and **ice hockey** appeared sporadically at the Summer Olympics (e.g., 1920 Antwerp).[1][3] Growing popularity of skiing and skating in Europe and North America led the IOC to support a dedicated “**International Winter Sports Week**” in France in 1924.[1][3]\n\n- **1924 – Chamonix, France (retroactively I Winter Olympics)**  \n  Organized as “International Winter Sports Week” under IOC patronage, later designated the first Winter Olympic Games.[1][3]  \n  - About **258 athletes** (247 men, 11 women) from **16 nations**.[3]  \n  - **Six sports/16 events**: bobsleigh, curling, figure skating, ice hockey, speed skating, and Nordic skiing (cross‑country, ski jumping, Nordic combined).[1][3]  \n  - Established the basic model for a separate Winter Games tradition.[1][3]\n\n- **Creation of a separate Winter Olympic Games**  \n  In **1925**, the IOC formally created a distinct **Olympic Winter Games**, retroactively recognizing Chamonix 1924 as the first edition and awarding **St. Moritz, Switzerland** the 1928 Games.[1]\n\n- **1928 – St. Moritz, Switzerland**  \n  First Games officially organized as “Olympic Winter Games.”[1] St. Moritz’s alpine setting helped solidify the image of a mountain-based winter festival.\n\n- **1932 – Lake Placid, USA**  \n  First Winter Olympics held **outside Europe**, signaling early global expansion beyond the European core.[1]\n\n- **1936 – Garmisch‑Partenkirchen, Germany**  \n  - Hosted in Nazi Germany, mirroring the propaganda context of the 1936 Berlin Summer Games.  \n  - **Alpine skiing** was added to the Olympic winter program, marking the rise of modern downhill ski disciplines.[2]\n\n---\n\n### War interruption and postwar consolidation (1940–1960)\n\n- **Cancellations during World War II**  \n  Winter Games scheduled for **1940** and **1944** were **canceled** due to the war, interrupting the four‑year cycle.[1]\n\n- **1948 – St. Moritz, Switzerland**  \n  First postwar Winter Olympics, held in neutral Switzerland.[1] Germany and Japan, excluded from the 1948 Summer Games, also did not participate in these early postwar events.\n\n- **1952 – Oslo, Norway**  \n  The Games returned to Scandinavia, the birthplace of many Nordic skiing traditions.[1]\n\n- **1956 – Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy**  \n  Marked increased television interest and laid groundwork for the media‑driven growth of later Games.[1]\n\n- **1960 – Squaw Valley (now Palisades Tahoe), USA**  \n  - Showcased extensive **television coverage**, accelerating commercialization and global visibility.  \n  - **Biathlon**—combining cross‑country skiing and rifle shooting, derived from the older “military patrol” event—was added as a medal sport.[2][3]\n\n---\n\n### Expansion of venues and sports (1960s–1980s)\n\n- **1964 – Innsbruck, Austria**  \n  - Hosted amid concerns over snow conditions, prompting large‑scale snow storage and transport efforts—an early example of climate-related operational challenges.  \n  - **Luge** was added to the Winter Olympic program.[2]\n\n- **1968, 1972, 1976**  \n  While specific host cities are not detailed in the provided sources, this era saw:  \n  - Growth in the number of participating nations and events.  \n  - Rising television revenues, making the Games financially significant for hosts and the IOC.[1]\n\n- **1980 – Lake Placid, USA (second time)**  \n  Known historically for iconic moments like the “Miracle on Ice” (noted widely in Olympic histories, though not in the cited pages), and increased Cold War symbolism around East–West rivalry in winter sports.\n\n- **1984 – Sarajevo, Yugoslavia**  \n  First Winter Games in a socialist, non‑aligned country; later remembered against the backdrop of the 1990s Balkan conflicts.\n\n- **1988 – Calgary, Canada**  \n  - Marked a major step in **commercialization** and large‑scale broadcast production for winter sports.[1]  \n  - **Freestyle skiing** and **short track speed skating** appeared as **demonstration sports**, foreshadowing program shifts toward more dynamic, TV‑friendly events.[2]\n\n---\n\n### Separation from the Summer Games and new disciplines (1990s)\n\n- **Until 1992**  \n  Winter and Summer Games were held in the **same year** every four years.[1][3]\n\n- **IOC reform (1986)**  \n  At the **91st IOC Session (1986)**, members decided to **separate** the Summer and Winter Games onto **staggered four‑year cycles in different even‑numbered years**.[1] The aims were to:  \n  - Spread logistical and financial demands.  \n  - Generate steady **broadcast and sponsorship revenue** by holding Olympics every two years (alternating Winter/Summer).[1][3]\n\n- **1992 – Albertville, France**  \n  Last Winter Olympics held in the same year as a Summer Games.[1]  \n  - **Short track speed skating** and **moguls** (freestyle skiing) became official medal events after their demonstration in 1988.[2]\n\n- **1994 – Lillehammer, Norway**  \n  - First Winter Games held **two years after** the previous edition, inaugurating the new staggered cycle.[1][3]  \n  - **Aerials** in freestyle skiing became a medal event, expanding the freestyle program.[2]  \n  - Lillehammer became a reference point for “human‑scale” Games with strong environmental and cultural branding.\n\n- **1998 – Nagano, Japan**  \n  - First Winter Olympics in Asia since Sapporo 1972 (noted in broader histories).  \n  - **Snowboarding** debuted as an Olympic sport (giant slalom and halfpipe), reflecting the rise of youth and action sports.[2]  \n  - **Curling**, present in 1924 then dropped, returned as a full medal sport.[2][3]\n\n---\n\n### Commercial mega-event and action sports era (2000s–2010s)\n\n- **2002 – Salt Lake City, USA**  \n  - Marked by post‑9/11 security concerns and extensive broadcast coverage.  \n  - **Skeleton** was reintroduced as a permanent Olympic winter sport after an earlier appearance in 1928 and 1948.[2]\n\n- **2006 – Torino, Italy**  \n  - Added **snowboard cross** (boardercross) and a **mass start** event in **biathlon**, illustrating how new formats are used to keep sports television‑friendly and exciting.[2]\n\n- **2010 – Vancouver, Canada**  \n  - Introduced **ski cross** in freestyle skiing.[2]  \n  - Featured large urban celebrations and further integrated digital media, social networking, and high‑definition broadcasts.\n\n- **2014 – Sochi, Russia**  \n  - Marked a significant expansion of “action sports” and new team formats:  \n    - **Ski slopestyle**, **snowboard slopestyle**, and **ski halfpipe** were added (men’s and women’s).[2]  \n    - A **team figure skating** event debuted.[2]  \n  - Record‑level spending on venues and infrastructure; geopolitical tensions and human‑rights debates framed international discussion of the Games (noted in many contemporary reports beyond the cited pages).\n\n- **2018 – PyeongChang, South Korea**  \n  - Added **mixed doubles curling**, **snowboard big air**, and **speed skating mass start** events.[2]  \n  - Continued the trend toward **mixed‑gender** and **spectator‑friendly** formats, aligning with the IOC’s push for gender balance and youth appeal.[2]\n\n---\n\n### Recent developments and future direction (2020s)\n\n- **2022 – Beijing, China**  \n  - Beijing became the first city to host both Summer (2008) and Winter Olympics.  \n  - The Games took place during the COVID‑19 era with extensive health protocols (context drawn from general Olympic coverage, though not explicit in the cited pages).  \n  - New events included **women’s monobob**, **mixed team aerials** (freestyle skiing), and a **mixed team relay in short track**, further expanding mixed‑gender and women’s events.[2]\n\n- **2026 – Milano Cortina, Italy (upcoming)**  \n  - Represents a multi‑city, region‑based model using existing and renovated venues across northern Italy.  \n  - Program changes include:  \n    - New **sport**: **ski mountaineering** added to the Winter Olympic program for the first time.[2]  \n    - New or expanded events such as **women’s doubles in luge**, **women’s individual large hill in ski jumping**, a **mixed team event in skeleton**, and **dual moguls** in freestyle skiing.[2]  \n  - These changes underscore ongoing efforts to balance tradition (Nordic skiing, skating) with new alpine and freestyle disciplines aimed at younger audiences.[2]\n\n---\n\n### Structural and programmatic evolution\n\nAcross 100 years, several broader trends have reshaped the Winter Olympics:\n\n- **Growth in scale**  \n  The Winter Olympics expanded from **16 events and 16 nations** in 1924 to **over 100 events and more than 90 nations** in the early 21st century.[3] Athlete participation increased from 258 in Chamonix to several thousand in recent Games.[1][3]\n\n- **Geographical diversification**  \n  Initially concentrated in the **Alps and Scandinavia**, hosts gradually spread to North America (Lake Placid, Squaw Valley, Calgary, Salt Lake City, Vancouver), Asia (Sapporo, Nagano, PyeongChang, Beijing), Eastern Europe (Sarajevo, Sochi), and a wider range of European regions.[1][5]\n\n- **Sport program innovation**  \n  - Early core: **Nordic skiing, speed skating, figure skating, ice hockey, bobsleigh, curling**.[1][3]  \n  - Mid‑century additions: **alpine skiing** (1936), **biathlon** (1960), **luge** (1964).[2]  \n  - Late 20th century: **freestyle skiing**, **short track**, **snowboarding**, **skeleton**.[2]  \n  - 21st century: expanding **X‑Games‑style events** (slopestyle, halfpipe, big air, cross), **mixed‑team formats**, and new sports such as **ski mountaineering** for 2026.[2]\n\n- **Gender balance and mixed events**  \n  Women participated in figure skating and some early disciplines but were under‑represented; over time, women’s events expanded across almost all sports, and **mixed‑gender events** (e.g., mixed doubles curling, mixed team aerials) have become a key IOC emphasis.[2][3]\n\n- **Scheduling and commercialization**  \n  The decision to **separate the Winter and Summer Games starting in 1994** transformed the Winter Olympics into a stand‑alone global event with its own media and marketing cycle, generating Olympic‑related revenue every two years rather than every four.[1][3]\n\n- **Politics, environment, and legacy**  \n  The Winter Games have intersected with global politics (Nazi Germany 1936, Cold War rivalries, post‑Soviet and contemporary geopolitics) and increasingly with **environmental issues**, as hosts confront climate change, snow reliability, and sustainability, leading to more reuse of existing venues and regional hosting models (e.g., Milano–Cortina).[1][5]\n\nIf you’d like, I can turn this into a compact timeline listing each Winter Games from 1924 onward with host city, notable firsts, and key sports changes.",

          "content": "NASA’s Perseverance rover has four main science goals: **study past habitability**, **search for signs of ancient microbial life**, **collect and cache rock and soil samples for possible return to Earth**, and **test technologies to support future human missions**.[3][1] Jezero Crater was chosen as the landing site because strong evidence shows it once hosted a long‑lived lake and river delta, making it one of the most promising places on Mars to preserve biosignatures in sedimentary rocks.[3][1][2]\n\n**Science goals of Perseverance**\n\nPerseverance is the Mars 2020 rover in NASA’s Mars Exploration Program, and its mission-level science objectives are:[3][1][2][5]\n\n1. **Studying Mars’ habitability (past environments)**\n   - Reconstruct the **ancient environment** at Jezero Crater by studying its rocks, sediments, and geological context.[1][2]  \n   - Determine whether Jezero once had conditions that were **habitable**, such as long‑lasting liquid water, suitable chemistry, and energy sources.[1][3]  \n   - Examine the **climate history** recorded in rock layers, to understand how Mars’ environment evolved over billions of years.[1][2][5]  \n\n2. **Seeking signs of past microbial life (astrobiology)**\n   - Search for **biosignatures**—textural, chemical, or mineralogical evidence that could indicate past microbial life—in rocks that formed in water and are most likely to preserve such evidence.[1][2][3]  \n   - Focus on rocks with **high biosignature preservation potential**, such as fine‑grained sediments in the ancient lakebed and delta deposits.[1]  \n   - Use observations of habitability and preservation to **target the most promising locations** for detailed investigation.[1][2]  \n\n3. **Collecting and caching samples for Mars Sample Return**\n   - Drill **core samples of Martian rock and regolith** and seal them in tubes, caching a carefully documented set that captures the **geologic diversity** of Jezero Crater.[3][1][2]  \n   - Prepare these samples for possible **return to Earth** by a future mission, where laboratory instruments far more capable than those on a rover can analyze them for detailed geochemistry, mineralogy, and possible biosignatures.[3][1][2][4][6]  \n\n4. **Preparing for future human exploration**\n   - Demonstrate **in‑situ resource utilization (ISRU)**, notably producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere (e.g., MOXIE technology) as a step toward making propellant and breathable oxygen on Mars.[1][6]  \n   - Characterize **atmospheric dust, weather, and environmental conditions** that will affect human systems and health.[1][6]  \n   - Improve **landing and surface operations technologies**, informing safer and more precise landings for future crewed missions.[1][6]  \n\nThese mission-level objectives implement the broader Mars Exploration Program themes: **life, climate, geology, and preparation for humans**.[5][8]\n\n**Why Jezero Crater is a significant landing site**\n\nJezero Crater is considered one of the most scientifically valuable locations on Mars for addressing these goals.[3][1][2][5][7]\n\n1. **Ancient lake and river delta**\n   - Remote sensing data show that **more than 3.5 billion years ago**, river channels breached Jezero’s rim, **flooded the crater**, and created a **long‑lived lake**.[3]  \n   - The crater hosts one of the **best‑preserved river delta deposits** on Mars—a fan‑shaped accumulation of sediments where a river flowed into the lake.[3][7]  \n   - The presence of both **inflow and outflow channels** indicates the lake was not ephemeral; water likely stood in the crater long enough to allow extensive sediment deposition.[7]  \n\n2. **High potential for biosignature preservation**\n   - On Earth, lake and delta environments with **fine‑grained sediments** are excellent at preserving **microbial fossils and chemical biosignatures**; Jezero offers a Mars analog of this setting.[2][3][7]  \n   - Sediments in a quiet lakebed and delta can trap and bury organic matter, potentially preserving signs of life for billions of years.[2][3]  \n   - Perseverance targets precisely these deposit types because they maximize the chance of finding **fossil biosignatures**, if life ever existed there.[1][2]  \n\n3. **Evidence of water‑related minerals**\n   - Orbital observations reveal that Jezero’s rocks contain **clay minerals and carbonates**, which typically form in the presence of liquid water and can help buffer pH, supporting habitable conditions.[3][1][5]  \n   - Such minerals can **encapsulate and preserve organic molecules** and microstructures, making them prime targets for astrobiology.[1][2]  \n\n4. **Geologic diversity and a long time record**\n   - Jezero combines **ancient crater floor rocks**, sedimentary lake and delta deposits, and materials from the surrounding highlands delivered by rivers.[1][3][5]  \n   - This diversity allows Perseverance to investigate **multiple geologic environments and time periods** within a single traversable region, helping reconstruct the **“on‑again, off‑again” wet history** of Mars.[3]  \n   - Exposed layers act as a **stratigraphic record**, capturing changing environmental and climate conditions as each layer formed.[2][5]  \n\n5. **Strategic value for Mars Sample Return**\n   - Because Jezero’s rocks are both **geologically diverse** and **potentially biosignature‑rich**, samples from this site are expected to be highly valuable for **Mars Sample Return**.[3][1][2]  \n   - The cached samples will likely include lakebed mudstones, deltaic sandstones, altered crater floor rocks, and possibly wind‑blown materials and atmosphere samples, together providing a comprehensive record of the site’s history.[3][1]  \n\nIn summary, Perseverance’s science goals are tightly coupled to the unique attributes of Jezero Crater: a once‑wet, mineral‑rich, geologically diverse site that offers one of the best natural laboratories on Mars to determine whether the planet was ever inhabited, how its environment evolved, and how future human explorers might live there.",

### Key Parameters

* **`media_response.overrides.return_videos`**: Set to `true` to enable video returns
* **Response format**: Videos appear in the `videos` array with `url`, `thumbnail_url`, and metadata
* **Performance**: Video-enabled requests may take longer to process and produce larger responses

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Image optimization**: Compress images before encoding to reduce payload size and token costs. Resize very large images before sending.

  **File preparation**: Ensure documents are text-based (not scanned images). For URLs, verify they return the file directly, not a preview page.

  **Filter strategy**: Start with broad filters and gradually refine based on result quality. Keep filter lists concise (≤10 entries) for best performance.
