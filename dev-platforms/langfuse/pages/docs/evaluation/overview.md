seoTitle: "Evaluation of LLM Applications"
description: With Langfuse you can capture all your LLM evaluations in one place. You can combine a variety of different evaluation metrics like model-based evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), human annotations or fully custom evaluation workflows via API/SDKs. This allows you to measure quality, tonality, factual accuracy, completeness, and other dimensions of your LLM application.

# Evaluation Overview

Evals give you a repeatable check of your LLM application's behavior. You replace guesswork with data, and catch regressions before you ship a change.

  ![Score Analytics dashboard in Langfuse showing evaluation scores trended over time across multiple evaluators.](/images/docs/score-analytics-full-dashboard.png)

Evaluation runs across most of the [AI engineering loop](/academy/ai-engineering-loop): you score live traces in production, turn interesting examples into datasets, run experiments to compare changes, and judge the results with manual or automated evaluators. It happens both **online**, on live production traces, and **offline**, before you ship a change.

The AI Engineering Loop:

- [Trace](/academy/tracing): traces, sessions, agents, prompts
- [Monitor](/academy/monitoring): dashboards, LLM-as-judge, feedback
- [Build datasets](/academy/datasets): datasets, features-as-tests
- [Experiment](/academy/experiments): prompts, models, code variants
- [Evaluate](/academy/evaluate): judges, custom evals, annotation

[**Watch this walkthrough**](/watch-demo) of Langfuse Evaluation and how to use it to improve your LLM application.

## Getting Started

You can evaluate both:

- [live incoming traces](/docs/evaluation/get-started/online) to measure quality on production data and track trends over time.
- [your existing application on a pre-defined dataset](/docs/evaluation/get-started/offline), to make sure your changes are ready for production.

For more information on how evaluators, scores, datasets, and experiments fit together, read [Core Concepts](/docs/evaluation/core-concepts).

To catch regressions before they ship, run experiments in CI: add the [`langfuse/experiment-action`](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-ci-cd) GitHub Action to a `pull_request` workflow and raise `RegressionError` from your experiment script when a score violates your threshold; the action then fails the job. It works with Langfuse Cloud and self-hosted Langfuse.

## Agent Instructions

This page is part of the [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) documentation, published as plain Markdown for AI agents. Every page is available as Markdown by appending `.md` to its URL, or by sending an `Accept: text/markdown` header. This page: `https://langfuse.com/docs/evaluation/overview.md`.

### Querying these docs

If the answer is not on this page, query the documentation instead of guessing:

- **Semantic search** across all Langfuse docs, returning an answer with the relevant pages and excerpts. Ask a specific, self-contained question:

  ```bash
  curl -sG "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs" --data-urlencode "query=How do I trace a LangGraph agent?"
  ```

- **Index of every page**: <https://langfuse.com/llms.txt>, with per-section indexes [llms-docs.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-docs.txt), [llms-integrations.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-integrations.txt), and [llms-self-hosting.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms-self-hosting.txt).

### Before writing Langfuse code

- **Install the [Langfuse Agent Skill](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/agent-skill).** It encodes Langfuse's own best practices for instrumentation, prompt management, and evaluation, and materially improves results.
- **Read [What does a good trace look like?](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/best-practices.md)** before instrumenting an application.
- **Verify endpoints, parameters, and response fields** against the [API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) instead of inferring them from code examples.
- **Use the [Langfuse CLI](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/cli)** (`npx @langfuse/cli api <resource> <action>`) to read or write traces, prompts, datasets, and scores from the terminal.
