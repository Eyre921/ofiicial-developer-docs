## Parameters

- [`adaptive_pricing`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=adaptive_pricing) (object, optional)
  Settings for price localization with [Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing.md).

- [`after_expiration`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=after_expiration) (object, optional)
  Configure actions after a Checkout Session has expired. You can’t set this parameter if `ui_mode` is `elements`.

- `allow_promotion_codes` (boolean, optional)
  Enables user redeemable promotion codes.

- [`automatic_tax`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=automatic_tax) (object, optional)
  Settings for automatic tax lookup for this session and resulting payments, invoices, and subscriptions.

- `billing_address_collection` (enum, optional)
  Specify whether Checkout should collect the customer’s billing address. Defaults to `auto`.
Possible enum values:
  - `auto`
    Checkout will only collect the billing address when necessary. When using [automatic_tax](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-automatic_tax-enabled), Checkout will collect the minimum number of fields required for tax calculation.

  - `required`
    Checkout will always collect the customer’s billing address.

- [`branding_settings`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=branding_settings) (object, optional)
  The branding settings for the Checkout Session. This parameter is not allowed if ui_mode is `elements`.

- `cancel_url` (string, optional)
  If set, Checkout displays a back button and customers will be directed to this URL if they decide to cancel payment and return to your website. This parameter is not allowed if ui_mode is `embedded_page` or `elements`.

- `client_reference_id` (string, optional)
  A unique string to reference the Checkout Session. This can be a customer ID, a cart ID, or similar, and can be used to reconcile the session with your internal systems.

  The maximum length is 200 characters.

- [`consent_collection`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=consent_collection) (object, optional)
  Configure fields for the Checkout Session to gather active consent from customers.

- `currency` (enum, required conditionally)
  Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies.md). Required in `setup` mode when `payment_method_types` is not set.

- [`custom_fields`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=custom_fields) (array of objects, optional)
  Collect additional information from your customer using custom fields. Up to 3 fields are supported. You can’t set this parameter if `ui_mode` is `custom`.

- [`custom_text`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md?query=custom_text) (object, optional)
  Display additional text for your customers using custom text. You can’t set this parameter if `ui_mode` is `custom`.

- `customer` (string, optional)
  ID of an existing Customer, if one exists. In `payment` mode, the customer’s most recently saved card payment method will be used to prefill the email, name, card details, and billing address on the Checkout page. In `subscription` mode, the customer’s [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update.md#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) will be used if it’s a card, otherwise the most recently saved card will be used. A valid billing address, billing name and billing email are required on the payment method for Checkout to prefill the customer’s card details.

  If the Customer already has a valid [email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-email) set, the email will be prefilled and not editable in Checkout. If the Customer does not have a valid `email`, Checkout will set the email entered during the session on the Customer.

  If blank for Checkout Sessions in `subscription` mode or with `customer_creation` set as `always` in `payment` mode, Checkout will create a new Customer object based on information provided during the payment flow.

  You can set [`payment_intent_data.setup_future_usage`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-setup_future_usage) to have Checkout automatically attach the payment method to the Customer you pass in for future reuse.

- `customer_account` (string, optional)
  ID of an existing Account, if one exists. Has the same behavior as `customer`.

- `customer_creation` (enum, optional)
  Configure whether a Checkout Session creates a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) during Session confirmation.

  When a Customer is not created, you can still retrieve email, address, and other customer data entered in Checkout with [customer_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-customer_details).

  Sessions that don’t create Customers instead are grouped by [guest customers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers.md) in the Dashboard. Promotion codes limited to first time customers will return invalid for these Sessions.

  Can only be set in `payment` and `setup` mode.
Possible enum values:
  - `always`
    The Checkout Session will always create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) when a Session confirmation is attempted.

  - `if_required`
    The Checkout Session will only create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) if it is required for Session confirmation. Currently, only `subscription` mode Sessions and `payment` mode Sessions with [post-purchase invoices enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts.md?payment-ui=checkout#paid-invoices) require a Customer.

- `customer_email` (string, optional)
  If provided, this value will be used when the Customer object is created. If not provided, customers will be asked to enter their email address. Use this parameter to prefill customer data if you already have an email on file. To access information about the customer once a session is complete, use the `customer` field.

  The maximum length is 800 characters.

- `expires_at` (timestamp, optional)
  The Epoch time in seconds at which the Checkout Session will expire. It can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours after Checkout Session creation. By default, this value is 24 hours from creation.

- `integration_identifier` (string, optional)
  The integration identifier for this Checkout Session. Multiple Checkout Sessions can have the same integration identifier.

  The maximum length is 200 characters.
