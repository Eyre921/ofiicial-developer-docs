## Importing Data

You can import data into your Upstash Redis database from two sources: an existing backup or an RDB file.

<Warning>
  All existing data in the target database will be deleted before the import operation begins.
</Warning>

### Start an Import

To begin importing data:

* Go to the [Redis database list page](https://console.upstash.com/redis) in the Upstash console
* Click on the `Import...` button

You'll see a dialog with two import options:

### Option 1: Import from Backup

Import data from a backup of any existing database in your account or team:

* Select `From Backup` as the source
* Choose the source database (the database from which the backup was created)
* Select the backup you want to import from
* Select the target database (the database you want to import into)
* Click `Start Import`

### Option 2: Import from RDB File

Import data from an external Redis database by uploading an RDB file:

* Select `From RDB File` as the source
* Click `Upload RDB File` and select your RDB file
* Select the target database (the database you want to import into)
* Click `Start Import`

<Info>
  If you're importing from an external Redis database (from another provider or on-premise), you'll need to export it as an RDB file first.
</Info>

## Exporting Data

You'll be able to export your Upstash Redis database as an RDB file for backup or migration purposes.

### Request an Export

To export your database:

* Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
* Click on the `Backup & Export` button
* Choose `Export`

  <img width="800" />

Your database will be exported as an RDB file. Once you start the export, you'll see the export progress in the backups table.

### Download Your Export

Once the export completes, you'll see a `Download` button in the backups table:

* Find your export in the backups table
* Click the `Download` button to download the RDB file

<Info>
  Not all Redis data structures are included in RDB exports. Notably, Redis Functions data will not be available in the export.
