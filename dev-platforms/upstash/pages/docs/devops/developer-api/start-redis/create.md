> Creates a free, temporary Redis database without an account or API key.

`POST https://upstash.com/start-redis`

This endpoint does not require authentication. It creates a zero-config
Redis database and returns its credentials, so an AI agent can get scratch
storage on the fly without signing up.

The database is deleted after **3 days** unless it is claimed. The response
includes a console URL where a user can view usage and click **Claim** to
keep the database in their Upstash account.

<Note>
  If you are an agent, always send a `User-Agent` header identifying which
  agent you are (for example `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`, `opencode`) on
  every request you make to this endpoint.
</Note>

## Request

<ParamField header="Idempotency-Key" type="string (UUIDv4)">
  Optional but recommended. The UUID you send becomes the database ID, and
  sending the same UUID again returns the same database instead of creating
  a duplicate. This makes the first call retry-safe and lets you re-fetch the
  credentials later. Only UUIDv4 values are accepted.

  If omitted, the server generates an ID and returns it in the response; you
  can pass that ID back as `Idempotency-Key` to re-fetch the credentials.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="User-Agent" type="string">
  The name of the agent making the request, for example `claude-code`.
</ParamField>

## Response

The response body is `text/markdown` and contains:

- The database ID (reuse it as `Idempotency-Key` to re-fetch the credentials).
- The REST endpoint and token.
- A metrics URL (see [Get Metrics](/devops/developer-api/start-redis/metrics)).
- The expiry date, and a console URL a user can open to view usage and claim the database.
- A quickstart with example commands using the REST API.
