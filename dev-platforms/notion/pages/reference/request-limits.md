To ensure a consistent developer experience for all API users, the Notion API is rate limited and basic size limits apply to request parameters.

Workspace plan limits are separate from request limits. See [Workspace block limits](/reference/workspace-block-limits) for the Free workspace limit that takes effect on September 8, 2026.

## Rate limits

The Notion API enforces two rate limits: a per-connection limit and a per-workspace limit. Some endpoints also have their own limit.

### Per-connection limit

Each connection has a fixed budget of requests per 60-second window, based on the workspace's plan:

| Workspace plan          | Limit                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Business and Enterprise | 600 requests per minute (an average of 10 per second) |
| All other plans         | 180 requests per minute (an average of 3 per second)  |

The budget can be spent at any pace within the window — spread out evenly or in a single burst. When a request exceeds this limit, the `Retry-After` value is the time until the window resets, so it is at most 60 seconds.

### Per-workspace limit

A separate limit is shared across all of the workspace's connections and scaled to the workspace's plan. Because it's shared, requests can be rate limited even when each individual connection is within its per-connection limit. `Retry-After` for this limit can be longer than a minute.

### Rate limit responses

Requests that exceed a limit return a `"rate_limited"` error code and an HTTP 429 response. `additional_data.rate_limit_reason` says which limit was exceeded:

| `rate_limit_reason`                   | What to do                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public_api_request_rate_limit`       | This connection is sending requests too fast. Wait for `Retry-After`.                          |
| `public_api_space_request_rate_limit` | The workspace's shared budget is used up. Wait for `Retry-After`.                              |
| `public_api_endpoint_rate_limit`      | This endpoint has its own limit. Wait for `Retry-After`.                                       |
| `public_api_request_blocked`          | This connection's API access has been restricted. Retrying won't help. Contact Notion support. |

Other `rate_limit_reason` values can appear. Handle them like any other 429 and wait for `Retry-After`.

Connections should handle HTTP 429 and 529 responses and respect the `Retry-After` response header. The header value is an integer number of seconds. Use the returned value rather than assuming a fixed wait. A 529 response carries the `"service_overload"` code and means Notion is temporarily overloaded; retry it the same way as a 429. Whenever a response includes `Retry-After`, the body repeats the wait as `additional_data.retry_after`, a string of whole seconds, for clients that can't read response headers.

### Retry rate-limited requests

Put outgoing requests through a queue so a burst from one job does not consume the connection's full request budget. When Notion returns 429 or 529:

1. Read `Retry-After` and pause new requests for at least that many seconds.
2. Retry the failed request after the pause.
3. If another 429 or 529 arrives, increase the delay with exponential backoff and jitter.
4. Set a retry limit. Log or surface the final error when the limit is reached.

Do not retry every error. Retry 429 and 529 responses, except a 429 with `public_api_request_blocked`. Retry 500, 502, 503, and 504 responses only when the request is idempotent, such as GET or DELETE, unless your application has its own idempotency protection. A write that returns 503 needs an extra check first; see [Retry a write that returns 503](#retry-a-write-that-returns-503). Fix the request before retrying most 400 responses. A 401 means authentication failed. A 403 can mean a permission failure or a [workspace block limit](/reference/workspace-block-limits); check the error message before retrying.

The JavaScript SDK retries 429 responses for every method. It also retries 500 and 503 responses for GET and DELETE requests. It respects `Retry-After`, uses exponential backoff with jitter, and limits retries. If you call the REST API directly, use the same safeguards and add explicit handling for 529 responses. These examples show the same policy in several common HTTP clients:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JavaScript theme={null}
  async function notionRequest(url, options = {}, attempt = 0) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options)
    const method = (options.method ?? "GET").toUpperCase()
    const isIdempotent = method === "GET" || method === "DELETE"
    const retryable =
      response.status === 429 ||
      response.status === 529 ||
      (isIdempotent && [500, 502, 503, 504].includes(response.status))

    if (!retryable || attempt >= 5) {
      return response
    }

    const retryAfter = response.headers.get("retry-after")
    const retryAfterSeconds = Number(retryAfter)
    const exponentialDelaySeconds = Math.min(2 ** attempt, 30)
    const baseDelaySeconds = retryAfter !== null && Number.isFinite(retryAfterSeconds)
      ? retryAfterSeconds
      : exponentialDelaySeconds
    const jitterMs = Math.random() * 250

    await new Promise(resolve =>
      setTimeout(resolve, baseDelaySeconds * 1000 + jitterMs),
    )

    return notionRequest(url, options, attempt + 1)
  }
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import random
  import time

  import requests


  def notion_request(method, url, *, max_attempts=6, **kwargs):
      method = method.upper()
      is_idempotent = method in {"GET", "DELETE"}

      for attempt in range(max_attempts):
          response = requests.request(method, url, **kwargs)
          retryable = (
              response.status_code in {429, 529}
              or (
                  is_idempotent
                  and response.status_code in {500, 502, 503, 504}
              )
          )

          if not retryable or attempt == max_attempts - 1:
              return response

          retry_after = response.headers.get("Retry-After")
          delay = float(retry_after) if retry_after else min(2 ** attempt, 30)
          time.sleep(delay + random.uniform(0, 0.25))
  ```

  ```go Go theme={null}
  func notionRequest(client *http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
  	const maxAttempts = 6
  	isIdempotent := request.Method == http.MethodGet || request.Method == http.MethodDelete

  	for attempt := 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++ {
  		attemptRequest := request.Clone(request.Context())
  		if attempt > 0 && request.Body != nil {
  			if request.GetBody == nil {
  				return nil, errors.New("request body cannot be replayed")
  			}
  			body, err := request.GetBody()
  			if err != nil {
  				return nil, err
  			}
  			attemptRequest.Body = body
  		}

  		response, err := client.Do(attemptRequest)
  		if err != nil {
  			return nil, err
  		}

  		retryableServerError := response.StatusCode == 500 ||
  			response.StatusCode == 502 || response.StatusCode == 503 ||
  			response.StatusCode == 504
  		retryable := response.StatusCode == 429 || response.StatusCode == 529 ||
  			(isIdempotent && retryableServerError)
  		if !retryable || attempt == maxAttempts-1 {
  			return response, nil
  		}

  		response.Body.Close()
  		delay := time.Duration(1<<attempt) * time.Second
  		if delay > 30*time.Second {
  			delay = 30 * time.Second
  		}
  		if seconds, err := strconv.Atoi(response.Header.Get("Retry-After")); err == nil && seconds >= 0 {
  			delay = time.Duration(seconds) * time.Second
  		}
  		time.Sleep(delay + time.Duration(rand.Intn(250))*time.Millisecond)
  	}

  	panic("unreachable")
  }
  ```

  ```java Java theme={null}
  HttpResponse<String> notionRequest(
      HttpClient client,
      HttpRequest request
  ) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
      int maxAttempts = 6;
      boolean isIdempotent = Set.of("GET", "DELETE").contains(request.method());

      for (int attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
          HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(
              request,
              HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()
          );
          int status = response.statusCode();
          boolean retryable = status == 429 || status == 529 ||
              (isIdempotent && Set.of(500, 502, 503, 504).contains(status));

          if (!retryable || attempt == maxAttempts - 1) {
              return response;
          }

          long retryAfter = response.headers().firstValue("Retry-After")
              .map(Long::parseLong)
              .orElse(Math.min(1L << attempt, 30));
          long jitterMillis = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextLong(250);
          Thread.sleep(retryAfter * 1000 + jitterMillis);
      }

      throw new IllegalStateException("unreachable");
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The same rules apply in other languages: centralize retries in the HTTP client, respect `Retry-After`, add jitter, and cap the fallback delay and attempt count. Avoid independent retry loops in each worker; they can create a second traffic spike when the delay expires.

  **Rate limits may change**

  In the future, Notion plans to adjust rate limits to balance for demand and reliability.

### Retry a write that returns 503

A write can save its change and still return 503 when Notion runs out of time building the response. Repeating that write applies the change twice, so read `additional_data.retry_guidance` before you retry. When the change was already saved, the guidance tells you to read the object instead.

```json 503 response example theme={null}
{
  "object": "error",
  "status": 503,
  "code": "service_unavailable",
  "message": "The change was saved, but the response could not be built in time. Read the object again instead of repeating the write.",
  "additional_data": {
    "from": "publicApi.pageObjectPointerToPageObject.beforePreload",
    "elapsed_ms": "55012",
    "deadline_ms": "55000",
    "retry_guidance": [
      "Read the object again to confirm the saved change.",
      "Do not repeat the write."
    ]
  }
}
```

When the request created a page or a database, `additional_data.committed_resource_id` holds the ID of the new object. Use it to retrieve the object, since the timed-out response never returned that ID. Other requests that change an existing object omit the field, because you already have its ID.

When the request appended block children, `committed_resource_id` holds the parent block ID. `additional_data.committed_child_ids` lists the direct children created by this request, in request order. It excludes nested descendants. Retrieve each block with `GET /v1/blocks/:id`, using an ID from that list. These IDs distinguish your new blocks from identical existing blocks or blocks appended by another request. Do not repeat the write.

Other 503 responses carry different guidance, or none at all. Notion cannot always tell you whether a write was saved, so check the object's current state before you retry it.

## Size limits

Notion limits the size of certain parameters, and the depth of children in requests. A requests that exceeds any of these limits will return `"validation_error"` error code (HTTP response status 400) and contain more specific details in the `"message"` property.

Connections should avoid sending requests beyond these limits proactively. It may be helpful to use test data in your own test suite which intentionally contains large parameters to verify that the errors are handled appropriately. For example, if the connection reads a URL from an external system to put into a Notion page property, the connection should have a plan to deal with URLs that are beyond the length limit of 2000 characters. The connection might choose to log the error, or send an alert to the user who set up the connection via an email, or some other action.

Note that in addition to the property limits below, payloads have a maximum size of 1000 block elements and 500KB overall.

### Limits for property values

| Any email                                                                                             |                       | 200 characters    |

<Note>
  **Request size limits**

  These cap the size of a single request, not how much a property can hold. A relation property can contain far more than 100 related pages — the limit only governs how many you add or set in one request. Responses have separate limits; use [Retrieve a page property item](/reference/retrieve-a-page-property) to paginate through large values.
