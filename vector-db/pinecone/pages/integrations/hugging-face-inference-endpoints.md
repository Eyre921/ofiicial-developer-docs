Integrate Pinecone with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints for vector search, RAG, and production AI workloads.

Hugging Face Inference Endpoints offers a secure production solution to easily deploy any Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence-Transformers and Diffusion models from the Hub on dedicated and autoscaling infrastructure managed by Hugging Face.

Coupled with Pinecone, you can use Hugging Face to generate and index high-quality vector embeddings with ease.

## Setup guide

Hugging Face Inference Endpoints allows access to straightforward model inference. Coupled with Pinecone we can generate and index high-quality vector embeddings with ease.

Let's get started by initializing an Inference Endpoint for generating vector embeddings.

### Create an endpoint

We start by heading over to the [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints homepage](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/endpoints) and signing up for an account if needed. After, we should find ourselves on this page:

<img alt="endpoints 0" />

We click on **Create new endpoint**, choose a model repository (eg name of the model), endpoint name (this can be anything), and select a cloud environment. Before moving on it is *very important* that we set the **Task** to **Sentence Embeddings** (found within the *Advanced configuration* settings).

<img alt="endpoints 1" />

<img alt="endpoints 2" />

Other important options include the *Instance Type*, by default this uses CPU which is cheaper but also slower. For faster processing we need a GPU instance. And finally, we set our privacy setting near the end of the page.

After setting our options we can click **Create Endpoint** at the bottom of the page. This action should take use to the next page where we will see the current status of our endpoint.

<img alt="endpoints 3" />

Once the status has moved from **Building** to **Running** (this can take some time), we're ready to begin creating embeddings with it.

## Create embeddings

Each endpoint is given an **Endpoint URL**, it can be found on the endpoint **Overview** page. We need to assign this endpoint URL to the `endpoint_url` variable.

<img alt="endpoints 4" />

```Python Python theme={null}
endpoint = "<ENDPOINT_URL>"
```

We will also need the organization API token, we find this via the organization settings on Hugging Face (`https://huggingface.co/organizations/<ORG_NAME>/settings/profile`). This is assigned to the `api_org` variable.

<img alt="endpoints 5" />

```Python Python theme={null}
api_org = "<API_ORG_TOKEN>"
```

Now we're ready to create embeddings via Inference Endpoints. Let's start with a toy example.

```Python Python theme={null}
import requests

# add the api org token to the headers
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_org}'
}
# we add sentences to embed like so
json_data = {"inputs": ["a happy dog", "a sad dog"]}
# make the request
res = requests.post(
    endpoint,
    headers=headers,
    json=json_data
)
```

We should see a `200` response.

```Python Python theme={null}
res
```

```
<Response [200]>
```

Inside the response we should find two embeddings...

```Python Python theme={null}
len(res.json()['embeddings'])
```

```
2
```

We can also see the dimensionality of our embeddings like so:

```Python Python theme={null}
dim = len(res.json()['embeddings'][0])
dim
```

```
768
```

We will need more than two items to search through, so let's download a larger dataset. For this we will use Hugging Face datasets.

```Python Python theme={null}
from datasets import load_dataset

snli = load_dataset("snli", split='train')
snli
```

```
Downloading: 100%|██████████| 1.93k/1.93k [00:00<00:00, 992kB/s]
Downloading: 100%|██████████| 1.26M/1.26M [00:00<00:00, 31.2MB/s]
Downloading: 100%|██████████| 65.9M/65.9M [00:01<00:00, 57.9MB/s]
Downloading: 100%|██████████| 1.26M/1.26M [00:00<00:00, 43.6MB/s]

Dataset({
    features: ['premise', 'hypothesis', 'label'],
    num_rows: 550152
})
```

SNLI contains 550K sentence pairs, many of these include duplicate items so we will take just one set of these (the *hypothesis*) and deduplicate them.

```Python theme={null}
passages = list(set(snli['hypothesis']))
len(passages)
```

```
480042
```

We will drop to 50K sentences so that the example is quick to run, if you have time, feel free to keep the full 480K.

```Python Python theme={null}
passages = passages[:50_000]
```

## Create a Pinecone index

With our endpoint and dataset ready, all that we're missing is a vector database. For this, we need to initialize our connection to Pinecone, this requires a [free API key](https://app.pinecone.io/).

```Python Python theme={null}
import pinecone

# initialize connection to pinecone (get API key at app.pinecone.io)
pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="YOUR_ENVIRONMENT")

```

Now we create a new index called `'hf-endpoints'`, the name isn't important *but* the `dimension` must align to our endpoint model output dimensionality (we found this in `dim` above) and the model metric (typically `cosine` is okay, but not for all models).

```Python Python theme={null}
index_name = 'hf-endpoints'

# check if the hf-endpoints index exists
if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    # create the index if it does not exist
    pinecone.create_index(
        index_name,
        dimension=dim,
        metric="cosine"
    )

# connect to hf-endpoints index we created
index = pinecone.Index(index_name)
```

## Create and index embeddings

Now we have all of our components ready; endpoints, dataset, and Pinecone. Let's go ahead and create our dataset embeddings and index them within Pinecone.

```Python Python theme={null}
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

# we will use batches of 64
batch_size = 64

for i in tqdm(range(0, len(passages), batch_size)):
    # find end of batch
    i_end = min(i+batch_size, len(passages))
    # extract batch
    batch = passages[i:i_end]
    # generate embeddings for batch via endpoints
    res = requests.post(
        endpoint,
        headers=headers,
        json={"inputs": batch}
    )
    emb = res.json()['embeddings']
    # get metadata (just the original text)
    meta = [{'text': text} for text in batch]
    # create IDs
    ids = [str(x) for x in range(i, i_end)]
    # add all to upsert list
    to_upsert = list(zip(ids, emb, meta))
    # upsert/insert these records to pinecone
    _ = index.upsert(vectors=to_upsert)

# check that we have all vectors in index
index.describe_index_stats()
```

```
100%|██████████| 782/782 [11:02<00:00,  1.18it/s]

{'dimension': 768,
 'index_fullness': 0.1,
 'namespaces': {'': {'vector_count': 50000}},
 'total_vector_count': 50000}
```

With everything indexed we can begin querying. We will take a few examples from the *premise* column of the dataset.

```Python Python theme={null}
query = snli['premise'][0]
print(f"Query: {query}")
# encode with HF endpoints
res = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json={"inputs": query})
xq = res.json()['embeddings']
# query and return top 5
xc = index.query(xq, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
# iterate through results and print text
print("Answers:")
for match in xc['matches']:
    print(match['metadata']['text'])
```

```
Query: A person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane.
Answers:
The horse jumps over a toy airplane.
a lady rides a horse over a plane shaped obstacle
A person getting onto a horse.
person rides horse
A woman riding a horse jumps over a bar.
```

These look good, let's try a couple more examples.

```Python Python theme={null}
query = snli['premise'][100]
print(f"Query: {query}")
# encode with HF endpoints
res = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json={"inputs": query})
xq = res.json()['embeddings']
# query and return top 5
xc = index.query(xq, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
# iterate through results and print text
print("Answers:")
for match in xc['matches']:
    print(match['metadata']['text'])
```

```
Query: A woman is walking across the street eating a banana, while a man is following with his briefcase.
Answers:
A woman eats a banana and walks across a street, and there is a man trailing behind her.
A woman eats a banana split.
A woman is carrying two small watermelons and a purse while walking down the street.
The woman walked across the street.
A woman walking on the street with a monkey on her back.
```

And one more...

```Python Python theme={null}
query = snli['premise'][200]
print(f"Query: {query}")
# encode with HF endpoints
res = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json={"inputs": query})
xq = res.json()['embeddings']
# query and return top 5
xc = index.query(xq, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
# iterate through results and print text
print("Answers:")
for match in xc['matches']:
    print(match['metadata']['text'])
```

```
Query: People on bicycles waiting at an intersection.
Answers:
A pair of people on bikes are waiting at a stoplight.
Bike riders wait to cross the street.
people on bicycles
Group of bike riders stopped in the street.
There are bicycles outside.
```

All of these results look excellent. If you are not planning on running your endpoint and vector DB beyond this tutorial, you can shut down both.

## Clean up

Shut down the endpoint by navigating to the Inference Endpoints **Overview** page and selecting **Delete endpoint**. Delete the Pinecone index with:

```Python Python theme={null}
pinecone.delete_index(index_name)
```

<Note>Once the index is deleted, you cannot use it again.</Note>
