# Deploy Text-to-Speech (TTS) Services

> Deploy Deepgram's TTS services including Aura-2 for conversational AI voice synthesis

This guide covers deploying Deepgram's Text-to-Speech (TTS) services for conversational AI voice synthesis with ultra-low latency and high-quality natural speech generation.

Looking to deploy Speech-to-Text (STT) services instead? See the [Deploy STT Services](/docs/deploy-stt-services) guide.

**Deploying Flux TTS?** Flux TTS has unique deployment requirements and must be hosted on a separate Engine from Aura models. See the [Deploying Flux TTS](/docs/deploy-flux-tts) guide for Flux TTS-specific instructions.

As with other Deepgram self-hosted services, Deepgram TTS services use the same container images (`quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-api` and `quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-engine`) as STT deployments. However, **Deepgram strongly recommends configuring each node for a specific service type—either STT or TTS—for optimal performance and resource utilization**.

You need to download and deploy these images from a container image repository, along with TTS-specific configuration files and environment variables that will be provided by Deepgram.

## TTS Performance Considerations

### Latency and Throughput

**Latency** is the time delay between when a TTS API request is submitted and when you receive the first byte of audio data that can be played back to the end user.

**Throughput** refers to the number of TTS requests that can be processed successfully within a given time period.

There is a technical tradeoff between these metrics:

* **Lower request volume** = Lower latency per request, but lower overall throughput
* **Higher request volume** = Higher latency per request, but higher overall throughput

Finding the correct balance is essential for your application's success and to limit hardware costs. Your Deepgram Account Representative will assist with optimization.

### Dedicated Hardware Recommendation

**For optimal TTS performance, dedicate separate GPUs specifically for TTS traffic.** If you're already running STT services, route TTS requests to dedicated TTS-optimized hardware rather than sharing GPUs between STT and TTS workloads.

This dedicated approach is critical for:

* Real-time applications (voicebots) with strict latency requirements
* High-throughput applications optimizing for maximum hardware utilization

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to complete the [Deployment Environments](/docs/self-hosted-deployment-environments) guide, as well as all sub-guides to complete your environment configuration.

You will also need to complete the [Self Service Licensing & Credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial) guide to authenticate your products with Deepgram's licensing servers and pull Deepgram container images from [Quay](https://quay.io).

### Hardware Requirements

TTS self-hosted deployments have specific resource requirements:

* **GPU**: NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA 12.8+ support required
* **Memory**: 32-48 GiB RAM per language deployment
* **CPU**: 4+ cores per language deployment
* **Storage**: Sufficient space for model files and logs
* **NVIDIA Driver**: Compatible with CUDA 12.8 (driver versions change frequently - check NVIDIA compatibility matrix)
* **Container Runtime**: Docker with nvidia-container-runtime or Podman with GPU support

TTS hardware requirements are higher than standard STT deployments due to the computational complexity of high-quality speech synthesis. Consult your Deepgram Account Representative for hardware recommendations optimized for TTS latency vs. throughput based on your specific use case.

## TTS Models and Language Support

### Aura and Aura-2

This guide covers the Aura family of TTS models. Aura-2 supports both English and Spanish languages with superior quality and performance. You can choose to deploy:

* **Single language, single instance** - One API and Engine service pair
* **Single language, multiple instances** - Multiple API and Engine pairs for the same language (load balancing/redundancy)
* **Multiple languages** - English and Spanish services running side-by-side
* **Mixed deployment** - Any combination of the above

For multiple service deployments (same language or different languages), you'll need to:

* Modify ports for API and metrics servers to avoid conflicts
* Pin each instance to specific GPUs using CUDA device assignments
* Use appropriate UUIDs in Engine configurations for each language

### Legacy Aura Models

Previous generation Aura models may have different configuration requirements. Contact your Deepgram Account Representative for guidance on legacy model deployment.

### Flux TTS

Flux TTS is documented separately. See [Deploying Flux TTS](/docs/deploy-flux-tts).

## Get Deepgram Products

### Cache Container Image Repository Credentials

Use the image repository credentials you generated in the [self-service licensing and credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial#create-container-image-distribution-credentials) guide to login to Quay on your deployment environment. Once your credentials are cached locally, you should not have to log in again (until after you manually log out).

```shell Shell
# Complete with login information generated in Deepgram Console
docker login quay.io
```

## Deployment Methods

TTS services can be deployed using multiple container orchestration platforms:

### Docker Compose

Suitable for development, testing, and simple production deployments.

### Podman Compose

Alternative to Docker with similar functionality and compose file compatibility.

### Kubernetes with Helm

Recommended for production deployments requiring scaling, high availability, and advanced orchestration.

## Get Configuration Files

Configuration files are available in the [self-hosted-resources repository](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources).

1. Create your configuration directory:

   ```shell Shell
   mkdir -p config
   ```

2. Download the appropriate files for your deployment method:

   **Docker Compose:**

   * `docker/docker-compose.aura-2.yml` - Reference configuration with both English and Spanish

   **Podman Compose:**

   * `podman/podman-compose.aura-2.yml` - Reference configuration with both English and Spanish

   **Kubernetes/Helm:**

   * `charts/deepgram-self-hosted/samples/04-aura-2-setup.yaml` - Helm values example

   **Language-specific Configuration Files:**

   * `common/standard_deploy/api.aura-2-en.toml`
   * `common/standard_deploy/engine.aura-2-en.toml`
   * `common/standard_deploy/api.aura-2-es.toml`
   * `common/standard_deploy/engine.aura-2-es.toml`

   The reference compose files show both languages deployed side-by-side. You can modify these to deploy only the services you need.

## Customize Your Configuration

Once you have downloaded all provided files to your deployment machine, you need to update your configuration for your specific deployment environment.

### Credentials

You will need to have an environment variable `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` exported with your self-hosted API key secret. See our [Self Service Licensing & Credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial#create-a-self-hosted-api-key) guide for instructions on generating a self-hosted API key for use in this section.

Per the link above, you will create you self-hosted API key in the `API Key` tab of Deepgram Console. These are *not* created in the "Self-Hosted" tab, which is reserved for creating distribution credentials.

### Configuration Files

#### Compose File

The Docker Compose configuration files use the standard Deepgram self-hosted container images:

* `quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-api:release-250814`
* `quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-engine:release-250814`

While these are the same container images used for STT deployments, **Deepgram strongly recommends dedicating each node to either STT or TTS workloads**. Running mixed workloads on the same node can lead to suboptimal performance, resource contention, and unpredictable latency.

TTS functionality is enabled through specific configuration files, environment variables, and GPU assignments detailed below.

Make sure to export your self-hosted API key secret in your deployment environment.

```bash shell
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=API_KEY_SECRET
```

#### TTS Configuration Files

TTS deployments use service-specific configuration files and environment variables:

**Configuration Files by Language (Aura-2):**

* `api.aura-2-en.toml` - English API configuration pointing to English Engine
* `engine.aura-2-en.toml` - English Engine configuration
* `api.aura-2-es.toml` - Spanish API configuration pointing to Spanish Engine
* `engine.aura-2-es.toml` - Spanish Engine configuration

**Required Environment Variables by Language (Aura-2):**

*English Services:*

```bash
IMPELLER_AURA2_T2C_UUID="15ef8614-52cb-4cd3-a641-d68249c15d53"
IMPELLER_AURA2_C2A_UUID="2e5096c7-7bf1-435e-bbdd-f673f88d0ebd"
IMPELLER_AURA2_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=8
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1  # Adjust GPU assignment as needed
```

*Spanish Services:*

```bash
IMPELLER_AURA2_T2C_UUID="5d53d105-c6a4-47f5-b670-61adb6e8a880"
IMPELLER_AURA2_C2A_UUID="4d5c93ad-9e20-4ebf-a1f0-0fb88ac73ef5"
IMPELLER_AURA2_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=8
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3  # Adjust GPU assignment as needed
```

*Polyglot Services (Dutch, German, French, Italian, Japanese):*

```bash
IMPELLER_AURA2_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=8
IMPELLER_AURA2_T2C_UUID="04975889-c601-4f80-a02f-0f2f9c22deaf"
IMPELLER_AURA2_C2A_UUID="9e94567e-11e7-4619-adbc-d28212194367"
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3  # Adjust GPU assignment as needed
```

**Important Notes:**

* UUIDs are language-specific and must match the language being deployed
* `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` should be set to pin each service to specific GPUs
* For multiple instances of the same language, use the same UUIDs but different GPU assignments
* Batch size should be configured for your specific GPU and performance requirements

For legacy Aura models or other TTS configurations, consult your Deepgram Account Representative for the appropriate configuration files and environment variables.

## Testing Your Containers

To make sure your Deepgram self-hosted TTS deployment is properly configured and running, you will want to run the containers and make a sample request.

### Start the Deepgram Containers

Now that you have your configuration files setup up and in the correct location to be used by the container, use Docker Compose to run the container:

```shell Shell
cd config

# For Docker Compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.aura-2.yml up -d

# For Podman Compose
podman-compose -f podman-compose.aura-2.yml up -d

# With elevated privileges if needed
sudo --preserve-env=DEEPGRAM_API_KEY docker compose -f docker-compose.aura-2.yml up -d
```

If you get an error similar to the following, you may not have the minimum NVIDIA driver version required for Deepgram services to run properly. Please see [Drivers and Containerization Platforms](/docs/drivers-and-containerization-platforms#download-and-install-the-official-drivers) for instructions on installing/upgrading to the latest driver version.

You can then view the running containers with the container process status command, and optionally view the logs of each container to verify their status.

```shell Shell
docker ps
# Take note of the "Container ID" for each Deepgram container
docker logs CONTAINER_ID
```

Replace the placeholder `CONTAINER_ID` with the Container ID of each container whose logs you would like to inspect more completely.

### Networking Considerations

**Port Assignments:**
The reference configurations use these port mappings:

* **English API**: 8080
* **Spanish API**: 8081
* **English Engine Metrics**: 9991
* **Spanish Engine Metrics**: 9992

For custom deployments, ensure:

* Each API service uses a unique port
* Each Engine metrics port is unique
* Firewall rules allow access to your chosen API ports

**Protocol Usage:**
Unless you have HTTPS/TLS configured, use `http://` and `ws://` protocols:

* English: `http://localhost:8080/v1/speak`
* Spanish: `http://localhost:8081/v1/speak`
* Multiple English instances: `http://localhost:8080`, `http://localhost:8081`, etc.

### Test Your TTS Setup with Sample Requests

Test your environment and container setup with sample TTS requests.

1. Test your TTS deployment with speak requests:

   **Test English Service (Aura-2):**

   ```shell Shell
   curl --request POST \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --output tts-english-test.wav \
      --data '{"text":"This is a TTS English self-hosted test."}' \
      --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/speak?model=aura-2-thalia-en"
   ```

   **Test Spanish Service (Aura-2, if deployed):**

   ```shell Shell
   curl --request POST \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --output tts-spanish-test.wav \
      --data '{"text":"Esta es una prueba de TTS español alojado localmente."}' \
      --url "http://localhost:8081/v1/speak?model=aura-2-celeste-es"
   ```

   **Test Multiple English Instances (if deployed):**

   ```shell Shell
   # Test first English instance
   curl --request POST \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --output tts-en-instance-1.wav \
      --data '{"text":"Testing first English instance."}' \
      --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/speak?model=aura-2-thalia-en"

   # Test second English instance (if on different port)
   curl --request POST \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --output tts-en-instance-2.wav \
      --data '{"text":"Testing second English instance."}' \
      --url "http://localhost:8081/v1/speak?model=aura-2-thalia-en"
   ```

If you do not specify a `model`, the default voice model `aura-asteria-en` will be used. You can find all of our available voices [here](/docs/tts-models).

You should receive a response with the audio output. You can copy this file locally to manually evaluate the synthesized speech. Congratulations - your self-hosted TTS setup is working!
