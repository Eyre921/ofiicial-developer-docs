# Configure Endpointing and Interim Results

This guide shows you how to configure [endpointing](/docs/endpointing/) and [interim results](/docs/interim-results/) to control transcript delivery timing in your streaming application.

## Configure endpointing for pause detection

Endpointing detects pauses in speech and returns `speech_final: true` when a pause is detected. Use this to trigger downstream processing when a speaker stops talking.

1. Set the `endpointing` parameter to a millisecond value in your WebSocket connection:

```python Python
with client.listen.v1.connect(
    model="nova-3",
    language="en-US",
    endpointing=300  # 300ms of silence triggers speech_final
) as connection:
```

```java Java
import com.deepgram.api.DeepgramClient;
import com.deepgram.api.resources.listen.resources.v1.resources.v1websocket.V1WebSocketClient;

DeepgramClient client = DeepgramClient.builder().build();
V1WebSocketClient wsClient = client.listen().v1().v1WebSocket();
wsClient.connect(V1WebSocketOptions.builder()
    .model("nova-3")
    .language("en-US")
    .endpointing(300) // 300ms of silence triggers speech_final
    .build())
    .get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

2. Handle responses where `speech_final: true`:

```json JSON
{
  "is_final": true,
  "speech_final": true,
  "channel": {
    "alternatives": [{
      "transcript": "another big"
    }]
  }
}
```

**Recommended values:**

* **10ms (default):** Fast response for chatbots expecting short utterances
* **300-500ms:** Better for conversations where speakers pause mid-thought
* **`endpointing=false`:** Disable pause detection entirely

## Enable interim results for real-time feedback

Interim results provide preliminary transcripts as audio streams in, marked with `is_final: false`. When Deepgram reaches maximum accuracy for a segment, it sends a finalized transcript with `is_final: true`.

1. Set `interim_results=true` in your WebSocket connection:

```python Python
with client.listen.v1.connect(
    model="nova-3",
    language="en-US",
    interim_results=True,
    endpointing=300
) as connection:
```

```java Java
V1WebSocketClient wsClient = client.listen().v1().v1WebSocket();
wsClient.connect(V1WebSocketOptions.builder()
    .model("nova-3")
    .language("en-US")
    .interimResults(true)
    .endpointing(300)
    .build())
    .get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

2. Process responses based on the `is_final` flag:
   * `is_final: false` — Preliminary transcript, may change
   * `is_final: true` — Finalized transcript for this audio segment

## Combine both features for complete utterances

When using both features together, concatenate finalized transcripts to build complete utterances.

1. Enable both features in your WebSocket connection:

```python Python
with client.listen.v1.connect(
    model="nova-3",
    language="en-US",
    interim_results=True,
    endpointing=300
) as connection:
```

```java Java
V1WebSocketClient wsClient = client.listen().v1().v1WebSocket();
wsClient.connect(V1WebSocketOptions.builder()
    .model("nova-3")
    .language("en-US")
    .interimResults(true)
    .endpointing(300)
    .build())
    .get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

2. Append each `is_final: true` transcript to a buffer.

3. When `speech_final: true` arrives, the buffer contains the complete utterance.

4. Clear the buffer and start collecting the next utterance.

The following example shows how `is_final` and `speech_final` interact when a speaker dictates a credit card number:

```json JSON
1 0.000-1.100 ["is_final": false] ["speech_final": false] yeah so
2 0.000-2.200 ["is_final": false] ["speech_final": false] yeah so my credit card number
3 0.000-3.200 ["is_final": false] ["speech_final": false] yeah so my credit card number is two two
4 0.000-4.300 ["is_final": false] ["speech_final": false] yeah so my credit card number is two two two two three
5 0.000-3.260 ["is_final": true ] ["speech_final": false] yeah so my credit card number is two two
6 3.260-5.100 ["is_final": false] ["speech_final": false] two two three three three three
7 3.260-5.500 ["is_final": true ] ["speech_final": true ] two two three three three three
```

On line 5, `is_final: true` indicates a finalized transcript, but `speech_final: false` means the speaker hasn't paused yet. On line 7, both flags are `true`, signaling the end of an utterance. To get the complete transcript, concatenate lines 5 and 7.

Do not use `speech_final: true` alone to capture full transcripts. Long utterances may have multiple `is_final: true` responses before `speech_final: true` is returned.

## Implement utterance segmentation

For applications requiring complete sentences, add timing-based segmentation on top of endpointing.

1. Enable punctuation in your WebSocket connection:

```python Python
with client.listen.v1.connect(
    model="nova-3",
    language="en-US",
    interim_results=True,
    endpointing=300,
    punctuate=True
) as connection:
```

```java Java
V1WebSocketClient wsClient = client.listen().v1().v1WebSocket();
wsClient.connect(V1WebSocketOptions.builder()
    .model("nova-3")
    .language("en-US")
    .interimResults(true)
    .endpointing(300)
    .punctuate(true)
    .build())
    .get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

2. Process only `is_final: true` responses.

3. Break utterances at punctuation terminators or when the gap between adjacent words exceeds your threshold.

## Verify your configuration

Your configuration is working correctly when:

* Responses with `speech_final: true` arrive after detected pauses
* Interim results (`is_final: false`) update in real-time as audio streams
* Finalized transcripts (`is_final: true`) contain accurate text for each segment
* Complete utterances can be reconstructed by concatenating `is_final: true` responses until `speech_final: true`
