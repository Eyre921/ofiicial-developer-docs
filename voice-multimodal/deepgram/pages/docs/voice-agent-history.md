# History

Voice Agent

When starting a new conversation session with the Voice Agent, you can provide historical context about previous conversations and function calls using the `agent.context` parameter. This allows the agent to maintain awareness of prior interactions, enabling more coherent and contextual conversations.

## Purpose

History is particularly useful when:

* Resuming a conversation from a previous session
* Providing context about what has already been discussed
* Maintaining personality and conversation style consistency
* Enabling the agent to reference previous statements, topics, or function results
* Providing background context about function calls already executed
* Maintaining continuity in multi-session interactions

History can be disabled by setting `settings.flags.history` to `false` in the agent configuration. History is enabled by default.

| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`    | String | Must be "History" to identify this as a history message           |
