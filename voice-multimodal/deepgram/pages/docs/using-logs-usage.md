# Logs & Usage Data

You can obtain up to 90 days of log usage data from Deepgram. If you need log usage data for a longer period of time you can use our [Usage API ](/reference/manage/requests/list)to programmatically fetch usage data on an interval and store it for retrieval as needed.

# Using Console Logs & Usage

Within the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com) you can view your API usage and API log activity of all your requests.

### To view your Summarized Usage

> Not limited to 90 days.

1. Login to the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com)
2. Click on the Usage Tab in the left navigation panel.
3. On the Overview Tab, select your filter options.
4. View the results.

### To view your Logs

# Obtaining Usage via the API

You can use the Deepgram API to programmatically fetch usage data. Please refer to our [API documentation](/reference/manage/requests/list) for more details.

This also enables exporting and reporting on your usage, which can be imported into other tools of your choosing, such as Tableau, Grafana, or Datadog.

Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).

### Get All Requests

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`with your Deepgram project id.

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/requests?start=2023-10-01&end=2023-10-05&status=succeeded' \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

A response will be returned as such:

```json JSON
{
    "page": 0,
    "limit": 1,
    "requests": [
        {
            "request_id": "a758d58d-e3ec-xxx",
            "created": "2023-10-05T22:49:03.509654Z",

            "response": null,
            "callback": null
        }
    ]
}
```

### Summarize Usage

Summarized usage data is not limited to 90 days.

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`with your Deepgram project id.

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/usage?start=2023-10-01&end=2023-10-05' \
     --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'

## Understanding Console Usage Log States

Within the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com) you can view usage request logs and you may see requests in different states. Below is an explanation of what those states mean and a recommended resolution.

| State   | Meaning                                                                                  | Recommended Resolution                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending | Data on the response hasn't been recorded yet.                                           | Give the request time to process.                              |
| Unknown | We haven't confirmed the resolution of this request yet.                                 | Wait for the request to transition to Lost, Error, or Success. |
| Lost    | The resolution for this request was never logged. You won't be charged for this request. | Contact [Support](/support) for assistance.                    |
| Error   | This request had an error.                                                               | Retry the request.                                             |

## Retrieve Per-Request Pricing

You can retrieve the cost per-request in USD using the `Get a Project Request` [Deepgram Management API](/reference/manage/usage/get).
To do so, specify your Deepgram Project ID and Request ID in your API request. The response will include detailed information, including the cost.

## Example Payload

Refer to the `response.details.usd` field in the response.

Here is an example JSON response you would receive from this API.

```json
{
  "request_id": "fe02656d-e751-xxx",
  "project_uuid": "a0ec9ee3-e3a8-xxx",
  "created": "2025-08-27T14:55:40.714012Z",
