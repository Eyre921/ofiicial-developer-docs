# Getting Started with Speech to Text

With Deepgram’s STT API, you can transcribe both pre-recorded files and real-time streams, choose models optimized for different domains, and integrate transcription directly into your apps for use cases like conversational AI, live captions, and agent assist.

Before you start, consider your use case. Deepgram STT offers three main paths:
