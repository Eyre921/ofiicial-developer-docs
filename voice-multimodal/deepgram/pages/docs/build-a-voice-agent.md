# Build a Voice Agent

Deepgram's Voice Agent API uses a single WebSocket connection to handle the entire conversational loop. The API integrates speech-to-text, a large language model (LLM), and text-to-speech into one stream.

## How it works

Building a voice agent involves four main steps over a WebSocket:

1. **Open a connection**: Connect to the Deepgram Agent endpoint, `wss://agent.deepgram.com/v1/agent/converse`, using a supported SDK or a WebSocket client.
2. **Configure the agent**: Send a `Settings` message to define the models, voices, and behavior.
3. **Stream audio**: Send raw audio data to the agent.
4. **Handle events**: Listen for transcripts, agent responses, and audio output.

The Voice Agent API is available on the EU endpoint at `wss://api.eu.deepgram.com/v1/agent/converse` and the AU endpoint at `wss://api.au.deepgram.com/v1/agent/converse`. See [Regional Endpoints](/reference/regional-endpoints) for details.

## Rate limits

For information on concurrency limits, refer to the [API Rate Limits](/reference/api-rate-limits) documentation.

## Usage tracking

Deepgram calculates usage based on WebSocket connection time. One hour of connection time equals one hour of API usage.
