# Real-Time TTS with WebSockets

## Why Use WebSockets for TTS?

WebSockets provide a continuous audio stream flowing directly to the playback device without saving files to disk. This approach is essential for voice agents and conversational AI that require minimal latency and natural-sounding speech.

Key benefits include low latency, which allows audio playback to begin as soon as the first data chunk arrives, continuous streaming that maintains a persistent connection for rapid audio delivery, and efficient processing by streaming audio directly to playback devices.

## WebSocket Implementation Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to implement real-time TTS using Deepgram's WebSocket API:

```python

import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import time

from deepgram import DeepgramClient
from deepgram.core.events import EventType
from deepgram.speak.v1.types import SpeakV1Text

TTS_TEXT = "Hello, this is a text to speech example using Deepgram."

def main():
    try:
        # Create a Deepgram client using the API key from environment variables
        deepgram = DeepgramClient()

        # Create a websocket connection to Deepgram
        with deepgram.speak.v1.connect(
            model="aura-2-thalia-en",
            encoding="linear16",
            sample_rate=48000
        ) as dg_connection:

            def on_message(message) -> None:
                if isinstance(message, bytes):
                    print("Received audio chunk")
                    # Convert binary data to audio format playback devices understand
                    array = np.frombuffer(message, dtype=np.int16)
                    # Play the audio immediately upon receiving each chunk
                    sd.play(array, 48000)
                    sd.wait()
                else:
                    msg_type = getattr(message, "type", "Unknown")
                    print(f"Received {msg_type} event")

            dg_connection.on(EventType.OPEN, lambda _: print("Connection opened"))
            dg_connection.on(EventType.MESSAGE, on_message)
            dg_connection.on(EventType.CLOSE, lambda _: print("Connection closed"))
            dg_connection.on(EventType.ERROR, lambda error: print(f"Error: {error}"))

            dg_connection.start_listening()

            # Send text to be converted to speech
            dg_connection.send_text(SpeakV1Text(text=TTS_TEXT))

            # Send control messages
            dg_connection.send_flush()

            # Allow time for playback
            time.sleep(5)

            dg_connection.send_close()
            print("TTS stream completed")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```javascript Node.Js
const { DeepgramClient } = require('@deepgram/sdk');
const { Speaker } = require('speaker');

// Configure speaker for linear16 audio playback
const speaker = new Speaker({
  channels: 1,
  bitDepth: 16,

async function main() {
  try {
    // Create a WebSocket connection to Deepgram TTS
    const dgConnection = await deepgram.speak.v1.connect({
      model: "aura-2-thalia-en",
      encoding: "linear16",
      sample_rate: 48000
    });

    // Set up event handlers
    dgConnection.on('open', () => {
      console.log('Connection opened');

      // Send text to be converted to speech
      dgConnection.sendText({ type: "Text", text: TTS_TEXT });
    });

    // Handle messages (audio data and events)
    dgConnection.on('message', (data) => {
      if (typeof data === 'string') {
        console.log('Received audio chunk');
        // Play audio directly to speaker
        speaker.write(Buffer.from(data, 'base64'));
      }
    });

    // Handle connection close
    dgConnection.on('close', () => {
      console.log('Connection closed');
    });

    // Handle errors
    dgConnection.on('error', (error) => {
      console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    });

    dgConnection.connect();
    await dgConnection.waitForOpen();

    // Clean up after 5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Closing connection...');
      dgConnection.sendClose({ type: "Close" });
      console.log('TTS stream completed');
    }, 5000);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  }
}

main();
