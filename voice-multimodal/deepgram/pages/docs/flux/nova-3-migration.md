# Migrating from Nova-3 to Flux

## Key Benefits of Flux

* **Model-integrated turn detection** (`StartOfTurn`, `EagerEndOfTurn`, `TurnResumed`, `EndOfTurn`)
* **Ultra-low latency** \~260ms end-of-turn detection (p50 at defaults)
* **EagerEndOfTurn events** let you **start LLM responses early**
* **Turn-based transcripts** for clean agent logic
* **Same Nova 3 transcription quality**
* **Simplified development** one API replaces complex STT+VAD+endpointing pipelines, and conversation-native events.
* **High configurability** - Configurable end-of-turn detection sensitivity, eager response thresholds, and turn-taking dynamics for optimized conversational flow

## Audio Requirements

* **Encoding:** See [Audio Format Requirements](#audio-format-requirements) table below
* **Sample rates:** See [Audio Format Requirements](#audio-format-requirements) table below
* **Channels:** Mono only
* **Chunk size:** **80ms strongly recommended** for optimal model performance and latency.

## Migrating from Nova 3 to Flux

This guide will help you migrate from Nova 3 to Flux by highlighting key differences, setup changes, and implementation patterns.

### Differences

| Nova 3                                             | Flux                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Streams transcripts continuously                   | Emits structured turn events                |
| Requires custom logic for barge-in and turn-taking | Has built-in turn state machine             |
| Returns transcripts only                           | Returns conversation events and transcripts |
| Designed for general real-time transcription       | Designed for conversational voice agents    |
| Focuses on accuracy and speed                      | Focuses on accuracy and turn awareness      |

#### Endpoint Usage

**Nova 3:**

Uses the listen v1 endpoint with the `nova-3` model option.

```
wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3
```

**Flux:**

Uses the listen v2 endpoint with the `flux-general-en` model option.

```
wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/listen?model=flux-general-en
```

### Response Message Structure

#### Nova 3

```json
{
  "type": "Results",
  "channel": "transcript",
  "alternatives": [...]
}
```

#### Flux

```json
{
  "type": "TurnInfo",
  "request_id": "2ba892a1-6c0d-4d92-9b89-0000000000",
  "event": "Update",
  "turn_index": 0,
  "audio_window_start": 0,
  "audio_window_end": 0.47999996,
  "transcript": "",
  "words": [...],
  "end_of_turn_confidence": 0.0009,
  "sequence_id": 2
}
```

In addition to the transcript, flux responses include the:

* `event` field for turn-state changes
* `turn_index` to track turn lifecycle
* `audio_window_start` and `audio_window_end` to track the audio window.
* `end_of_turn_confidence` to track the confidence of the end of turn.
* `sequence_id` to track the sequence id of the messages.

### Implementation Pattern Changes

#### Nova 3 Approach

> Requires custom logic for barge-in and turn-taking.

* Send audio
* Receive streaming partial transcripts
* Decide when to interrupt your agent manually

#### Flux Approach

> Listens for structured events and removes the need for custom VAD or barge-in logic.

* `StartOfTurn`: Interrupt agent if it’s speaking
* `EagerEndOfTurn`: Medium-confidence end → start LLM reply
* `TurnResumed`: User kept talking → cancel reply
* `EndOfTurn`: High-confidence end → send transcript to LLM

By default, Flux only emits `Update`, `StartOfTurn`, and `EndOfTurn`.

### Simple Approach: Enabling End of Turn

For more information on using Flux with EndOfTurn only see the [Flux Getting Started Guide](/docs/flux/quickstart)

This is a simple approach using only `EndOfTurn` (lower latency, less complex, less LLM calls).

To enable end of turn use the `eot_threshold` parameter which allows for a confidence of (0.5–0.9) for `EndOfTurn` events.

#### Example

```curl
wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/listen?model=flux-general-en&sample_rate=16000&encoding=linear16&eot_threshold=0.8
```

### Optimized Approach: Enabling EagerEndOfTurn + EndOfTurn

This is an optimized approach using both EagerEndOfTurn and EndOfTurn (lower latency, slightly more complex, more LLM calls)

To enable eager end of turn use the `eager_eot_threshold` parameter which allows for a Confidence of (0.3–0.9). You can also set the `eot_threshold` with a confidence of (0.5–0.9) to handle `EndOfTurn` events and use the `eot_timeout_ms` which defaults to 5000 ms to force a timeout after a specified time.

#### Example

```curl
wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/listen?model=flux-general-en&sample_rate=16000&encoding=linear16&eager_eot_threshold=0.6&eot_threshold=0.8&eot_timeout_ms=7000
```

### Nova 3 Migration Checklist

* [ ] Update WebSocket endpoint to `/v2/listen`
* [ ] Set `model=flux-general-en` and `encoding=linear16`
* [ ] Adjust client to parse `TurnInfo` messages
* [ ] Implement turn event handling (start, eager end of turn, turn resumed, end)
* [ ] Tune `eager_eot_threshold` and `eot_threshold` for your use case
* [ ] Remove custom VAD/barge-in logic (Flux handles this natively!)
