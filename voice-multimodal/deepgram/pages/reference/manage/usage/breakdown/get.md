# Get Project Usage Breakdown

GET https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects/{project_id}/usage/breakdown

Retrieves the usage breakdown for a specific project, with various filter options by API feature or by groupings. Setting a feature (e.g. diarize) to true includes requests that used that feature, while false excludes requests that used it. Multiple true filters are combined with OR logic, while false filters use AND logic.
