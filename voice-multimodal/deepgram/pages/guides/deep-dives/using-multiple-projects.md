# Using Multiple Projects

## Overview

In Deepgram, projects are completely distinct environments with no connection to one another. Projects have unique access to Deepgram models, features, and services.

You can manage your Projects using either the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com) or the [Deepgram API](/reference/manage/projects/list). To learn more about Projects, see [Managing Projects](/guides/deep-dives/managing-projects).

In many cases, our users find that a single project is enough, but in certain scenarios, you may want to set up multiple projects.

## Your First Project

When you sign up, we automatically create a Project for you.

Any promotional credit you have earned is attached to this first project. If you would like to transfer your promotional balance to a new project, [contact Support](/support/).

## When to Create New Projects

In many cases, the first project that comes with your Deepgram account will be sufficient for your needs. However, depending on the different users you support, you may prefer to set up additional projects. Some examples include:

* You have two separate use cases for Deepgram products--one that involves a personal project and one that involves a completely unrelated business project.

* You have multiple, unrelated business projects, which are managed by different business teams or under different cost centers.

* You operate a business-to-business (B2B) model that focuses on selling products and services to other companies and have separate teams that handle individual customers. You may also want to create a separate project to track your customers' usage data separately for billing purposes, although this can also be accomplished using a single project.

## Serving Multiple Customers With a Single Project

Many Deepgram users are businesses serving other businesses. In this scenario, you may want to create separate projects for each of your customers to see their usage, but you don't have to--you can use a single Deepgram project to serve all of your customers and still separate out customer usage.

To do this, you must [create a separate API Key for each customer and tag it](/guides/fundamentals/authenticating#create-an-api-key) with the customer's information. You can then rely on the API Key tag to filter usage down to the individual request and bill your customer accordingly.

For example, say Fruit Company has customers Apple, Banana, and Pear. Fruit Company can have a single Deepgram project, but create three API Keys:

1. Production Key (`tag=apple`)
2. Production Key (`tag=banana`)
3. Production Key (`tag=pear`)

At the end of the month, Fruit Company can rely on those tags to correctly bill Apple, Banana, and Pear for their respective usage.
