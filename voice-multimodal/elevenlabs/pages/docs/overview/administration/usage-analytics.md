# Usage analytics

The Developers page provides tools to monitor and analyze your platform activity.

To access these tools, navigate to **Developers** at the bottom of the sidebar in both ElevenAgents and ElevenCreative.

If you are part of a multi-seat workspace, you can switch between data for your account and your workspace.

## Analytics

The **Analytics** tab includes **API Requests**, **Usage**, and **Webhooks**. You can filter and analyze data by time period (for example, hour, day, month, or year) and at different levels of granularity.

### API Requests

The API Requests view shows request volume and performance for your account or workspace. Metrics include:

* Total requests, which you can break down and filter
* Success rate
* Average latency
* Top called path

### Usage

The Usage view shows credit consumption and related performance metrics. Metrics include:

* Credit usage, which you can break down and filter (for example, by voice, product, or API key)
* Average time to first byte
* Average time to completed transcript
* Concurrent requests

When viewing workspace usage, you can also break usage down by individual user or workspace group.

### Webhooks

The Webhooks view shows webhook delivery activity for your account or workspace. Metrics include:
