# Image & Video

## Overview

Image & Video enables you to create high-quality visual content from simple text descriptions or reference images. Generate static images or dynamic videos in any style, then refine them iteratively with additional prompts, upscale for high-resolution output, and even add lip-sync with audio. Export finished assets as standalone files or import them directly into ElevenCreative Studio projects.

This feature is currently in beta.

Some Image & Video models and input upload capabilities are restricted in the United States due to
regulatory or provider requirements. Check individual model descriptions for specific
availability.

Free plan users can only generate images and are limited to three image requests per day. Video
generation requires a paid plan.

## Guide

Follow these steps to create your first visual asset:

### Select your mode

Use the toggle in the upper right corner of the prompt box to choose between **Image** or **Video** generation.

### Provide a prompt or reference

Describe your desired output using natural language in the prompt box. For more control, drag existing images or videos from the **Explore** or **History** tabs into the reference slots, or upload your own reference images in a wide range of file formats including JPG, PNG, WEBP, and more.

### Choose a model and settings

Select the ideal generative model for your goal (e.g., OpenAI Sora 2 Pro, Google Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, Flux 1 Kontext Pro). See the [Models](#models) section for detailed information on each model. Adjust settings like aspect ratio, resolution, duration (for video), and the number of variations to generate.

### Generate your asset

Click the **[Generate](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#generate-1)** button. Your assets will be created and displayed in the **[History](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#history-1)** tab for review.

### Enhance and refine

Use enhancement tools to perfect your media. **Upscale** the resolution, apply realistic **LipSync** with audio, or click **Recreate** to generate a new variation with the same settings.

### Share with others

Click the **Share** button to generate a unique link for your creation. Send it to teammates and collaborators to collect feedback.

### Export your creation

Download the asset as a standalone file or import it directly into an ElevenCreative Studio project.

## Workflow

The creation process moves you from inspiration to finished asset in four stages:

### [Explore](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#explore-1)

Discover community creations to find inspiration, study effective prompts, or pull references directly into your own work.

### [Generate](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#generate-1)

Use the prompt box to describe what you want to create, select a model, fine-tune your settings, and bring your idea to life.

### [History](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#history-1)

Review your generations in the History tab to iterate and enhance. Recreate variations, reuse prompts, and apply enhancements like upscaling and lip-syncing.

### [Export](/docs/eleven-creative/playground/image-video#export-1)

Download finished assets in various formats or send them directly to ElevenCreative Studio to use in your projects.

## Explore

The **Explore** tab displays a gallery of community creations for discovering inspiration and finding visuals to use as references.

**Search:** Use the search bar to find images and videos based on keywords.

**Sort:** Toggle between **Trending** and **Newest** to see what's popular or recently added.

**Drag-and-drop:** Pull any result from the grid directly into the prompt box to use as a start frame, end frame, or style reference.

**Preview details:** Click any tile to see the full prompt and settings used to create it.

**Adjust settings:** Fine-tune your generation with settings that appear below the prompt. These vary by model but often include:

* **Aspect Ratio**: Control the dimensions of your output
* **Resolution**: Set the quality level
* **Duration**: Specify video length (for video mode)
* **Number of Generations**: Create up to 4 variations at once

**Use controls:** On supported models, enable **Audio**, add a **Negative Prompt** to exclude unwanted elements, or adjust **Sound Control**.

For greater control over output, add visual references to guide generation. Availability depends on the selected model. We support a wide range of image file formats including JPG, PNG, WEBP, and more.

**Start Frame (Video):** Sets the opening image of your video.

**End Frame (Video):** Sets the final image, influencing the transition.

**Image Refs (Image or Video):** Provide one or more images to guide overall style and look.

Drag and drop items directly from the **Explore** or **History** tabs into reference slots for a
faster workflow.

## Models

Image & Video provides access to specialized models optimized for different use cases. Each model offers unique capabilities, from rapid iteration to production-ready quality.

Post-processing models require an existing generated output, though you can also upload your own image or video file.

Enterprise workspace admins can control which image and video generation models are available to
workspace members. By default, all models are disabled for Enterprise workspaces and must be
explicitly enabled by admins. Learn more about [Model approvals](/docs/overview/administration/workspaces/model-approvals).

For API requests, ByteDance models are disabled by default and require explicit approval before
use. Enterprise customers can contact support to request access.

Every model below is available in the Image & Video app. Models that can also be called from the
[Image & Video API](/docs/eleven-api/guides/cookbooks/image-and-video) list their `model_id` under
**API**; the rest are app-only.
